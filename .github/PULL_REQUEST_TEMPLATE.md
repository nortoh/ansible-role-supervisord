**Ticket:** <!-- Hyperlink the issue, e.g. [PROJ-123](https://liquidweb.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123)
(Jira) or [TEAM-123](https://linear.app/nexcess/issue/TEAM-123/slug) (Linear) — required, or
state why there isn't one -->

## Why

<!-- What problem does this solve, or what requirement does it fulfill? One sentence is usually
enough if there's a ticket — it should contain the details. -->

## What

<!-- What changed? Bullet points of the approach taken. -->

### Blast radius

<!-- e.g. backend-only / infra / cross-service / dependency change -->

### Deviations from spec

<!-- Bullet points: what, if anything, changed between the ticket's description and the final
implementation, and why. Delete this section if there's no spec to deviate from. -->

## Reading guide

<!-- Optional for a small change. For anything touching more than one file, map it for reviewers
before they read the diff. -->

## Test plan

**Automated tests added/updated:**
- [ ] N/A — this repo has no automated test suite (no Molecule scenarios, no CI)

**Manual verification steps:**
1. `ansible-playbook --syntax-check -i <inventory> <playbook>.yml`
2. `ansible-playbook -i <inventory> <playbook>.yml --check --diff` against a host running the role

## Deploy notes

<!-- Delete this section if not needed. -->

**Key/secret changes:** <!-- new secrets to provision, keys to issue, or config to update? -->
**Rollout order:** <!-- any sequencing required (e.g. migrate before deploying)? -->
**Rollback:** <!-- how to revert if this causes a problem in production? -->

## Checklist

- [ ] Verified manually against a playbook that includes the role (`--syntax-check`, `--check --diff`)
- [ ] Docs updated (`README.md`/`AGENTS.md`) if this changes how the project is built, run, or used
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, or real customer/financial data included
